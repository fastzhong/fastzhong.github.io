## 书籍

Docker Deep Dive: Zero to Docker in a single book

Kubernetes: Up and Running by Kubernetes founders Brendan Burns, Joe Beda, Kelsey Hightower is a good option as the first book for Kubernetes. It covers all foundational topics and doesn’t go into unnecessary rabbit holes.

Kubernetes in Action by Marko Luksa is the most comprehensive and advanced level book about Kubernetes. If there is only one book you should read about Kubernetes, that is it. If you are starting from scratch, it can be a bit heavy.

Kubernetes Patterns by Bilgin Ibryam (that’s me), Roland Huss is a good option if you already have some basic experience with Kubernetes and looking for patterns and reuse. It contains design patterns and best practices for developers and architects working with Kubernetes. Every pattern has a running example on Github, and currently the e-book is available for free

Kubernetes Best Practices by Brendan Burns, Eddie Villalba, Dave Strebel is good read if you want to take your Kubernetes management expertise to the next level. It contains tipcs and best practices focused for operating Kubernetes.
